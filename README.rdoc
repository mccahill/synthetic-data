== Synthetic

Synthetic is a web app to map users to Docker containers running a RStudio Shiny app
where they can design linear and logistic regression models to be fit against
synthetic data.

After the users have a model they like, they can submit the model to a private 
backend that contains sensitive data. The user's regression will be run on the
private backend which will then report back to the user the residuals for their 
model when run against the actual data.
